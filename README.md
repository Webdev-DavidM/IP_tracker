# Frontend Mentor - clock solution

## Overview

This project allows a user to enter an IP address and see the results of where the IP address is and also gives information. This project has allowed me to use Sass with the BEM methodology and also practice with typescipt and testing with jest and enzyme.

## Features

- When the app loads it loads with the inforamtion about the current user's IP address
- Regex is used to make sure a valid IP address is entered, if not an error is displayed
- When the user enters a valid IP address, a map of where the ISP provider is shown as well as data information.
