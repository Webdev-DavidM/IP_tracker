1. Create test files for each component with the describes, no tests initially

2. Create each component including sass, bottom up with tests, then create the
   component

3. Once the app is fully functional and working, save to github, then change the
   files to typescript files and get it working. I know this is the wrong way
   round but separating the testing and typescript ( as both are tests) is
   easier whilst I learn both.

4. send to Adrian for review and then make amendments

5. Finally create the read me and post onto github with screenshots and also
   adding git ignore to the relevant files
